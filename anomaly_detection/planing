planning:
- df division:
    $ read df from data.feather
    $ add column : 'is_val'
    for each class put 1 in 20% rows
    $ create feather file that contains the divison
- train the models:
    train as I did, but only if is_val == 0
-determine the thresholds:
    for each calss-
        ^ create df that contains:
            *1 the val of this class. 'is_from_class' = 1
            *2 x form the other class(from data). x is the num of *1. 'is_form_class' = 0
            = half is from this class and half is not
        ^ take the df and make predictions
        ^ do true,pred,positive,negative matrix
        ^ do histogram of the amount of each score (floor to 3 digit after point)
          the positive in one color and the negative in different.


# rows_to_set_one = np.random.choice(group.index, num_rows_to_set_one, replace=False)
    # group.loc[rows_to_set_one, 'column_name'] = 1
